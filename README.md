### It's me inside me.

My name is `Sungjin Han`.

My daily routines and activities are:

* 15 * 10 push ups + 5 * 5 pull ups + 20 * 5 slow burpees
* update things in my linux machines (Raspberry Pi 4B + oracle cloud instances)
* maintain my [dotfiles](https://github.com/meinside/dotfiles), including neovim configs
* check RSS feeds (mainly posts from [hacker news](https://news.ycombinator.com/))
* (work for a living)
* update things on my [steam deck](https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck) ~~(and turn it off without playing)~~
* and listen to music while washing dishes
